# Questions:
1. What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
    * First Skill: Reading and Writing 
    * Second Skill: attention to detail
    * Third Skill: Spotting differences

2. Please explain these three skills in your own words.
    * Reading and Writing : Writing codes require a special typing 
      skill especially with odd characters and learning this skill is 
      on of the essiential skills.
    
    * Attention to detail : This skill is essential since as a programmer 
      one should always be aware of the simple details. For example, 
      missing a semicolon can impact the whole program and will make 
      the whole program not to compile. By giving attention to the 
      thinnest details helps to fix bugs like this in an easy manner.
    
    * Spotting differences: Through coding and experience, one will 
      develop a skill where it is easier to notice changes and see the 
      difference between two codes. This is a skill that can be developed 
      through practice.
      

3. Why do you need to not copy and paste?
    * Copying and pasting makes the whole learning process invalid. The 
      way to learn programming is by typing codes and not directly coping 
      and pasting codes into our compiler/ program.

4. Why is Practice and Persistence important?
